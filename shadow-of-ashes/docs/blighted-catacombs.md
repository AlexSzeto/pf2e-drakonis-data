## Collapsed Escape

The PCs enter the Makeshift Prison 2 levels below ground.
It's a storeroom converted into a prison with a padlock added to the outside.

### Makeshift Prison
The padlock was not tempered.
Temporary straw bed in one corner
Bucket for waste. Used and not cleaned. (Guard can take it out)
Empty crates and barrels on the side. They don't seem used. Unlikely used for escape.
Secret door  (40xp) pushes inwards. A metal latch behind a stone brick to the right of the door DC18 unlocks the door DC24. Door is one way but can be easily propped open.

### Damp Corridor
Wet, recent and makeshift construction, poorly maintained.
Moldy. Exposed and sections looks poorly reinforced. Roof supports are buckling inwards
Exposed sections of the wall can be examined (Geology/Nature 15) to determine that the collapse is unnatural, DC18 to determine it is caused by a cave crawler

### Waiting room (half collapsed)
2 beds, table, 2 chairs, chest, bags, barrels
`Dagon Diary` (Brotherhood of Blood history)
`Bloodthirst Blade`
Stored food and water in barrels

- Worm tracks inside room
- Blood trail south and west


Level 3 Cave Crawler
