The PCs enter the Makeshift Prison 2 levels below ground.
It's a storeroom converted into a prison with a padlock added to the outside.

### Makeshift Prison
The padlock was not tempered.
Temporary straw bed in one corner
Bucket for waste. Used and not cleaned. (Guard can take it out)
Empty crates and barrels on the side. They don't seem used. Unlikely used for escape.
Secret door  (40xp) pushes inwards. A metal latch behind a stone brick to the right of the door DC18 unlocks the door DC24. Door is one way but can be easily propped open.

### Damp Corridor
Wet, recent and makeshift construction, poorly maintained.
Moldy. Exposed and sections looks poorly reinforced. Roof supports are buckling inwards
Exposed sections of the wall can be examined (Geology/Nature 15) to determine that the collapse is unnatural, DC18 to determine it is caused by a cave crawler

### Kobold Corpse
- Kobold Scout, dead for several days
- Wears an amulet of colored glass shards, small pouch of shells (currency), Kobold Scout equipment
```
Carrion Beetles x2 (40xp)
```

### Collapsed Room
- Barely standing plaster walls with painting of Ashling origin. Undecipherable words glow white by the darkstone.
```
Carrion Beetles x2 (40xp)
Crude Traps x2 (12xp)
```

### Waiting Room (half collapsed)
- 2 beds, table, 2 chairs, chest, bags, barrels
- signs of struggle, freshly disturbed earth, blood splatters,
- worm tracks everywhere

```
Level 3 Cave Crawler (80xp)
enters the area from an exposed wall but does not chase the player into other areas.
Roll d4 to determine spawn point, or block player directly trying to enter next area.
```

> ...Celebrated with fine wine the night before the wedding. The Burning Hands must persevere...

- Cooking pot is empty
