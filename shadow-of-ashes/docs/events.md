# Bidding Goodbye to the Survivors and Plans of Attack

The survivors of Xyndrasis continues to pack. Yitha leaves the
PCs to formulate a plan of attack with the PCs while she bids
her friends and loved ones goodbye. She is visibly shaken by Iloth's (the sheperd)
death.

> Well, now that we're determined to go to the temple, I'm actually not sure
how. We have been near it many times before, but anywhere near the temple
would be thick with the infected. I don't know if we have enough people to strong
arm our way in through the front. I need a drink.

## The council
Members of the council (including Iloth) attended a meeting about Keroc's occupation
before the city fell. The members consists of Iloth the Sheperd,
Tighis the Truthseeker, and Nyzassa the Oathkeeper, Grevik the Lawbinder,
and Pavulxa the Greenhand.

## Temple layout knowledge
Everyone should know the layout of the top floor. Most would know something about
the viewing chamber, the meditation room, and the living quarters below.

## Pavulxa's Story
Pavulxa is a well worn ashling with a mess of head of grey hair and a thin but firm
frame, built for farm work. She is the one who developed the antidote.
> The meeting went badly. Prince Renu had plans to replace the signs in the tunnels
to close off the city permenantly, and none of the rest of us agreed with him. We
were summarily dismissed. Nyzassa, bless her soul, cornered the Prince as the
rest of us prepare to leave. Gods know what had happened to the rest of them if
Iloth ended up the way he is. I can't even imagine.

## Hethor's Plan
Hethor and a few other younglings around his age are excitedly relating the fight
on the bridge that they had just witnessed. Hethor offers to help if the PCs don't
have a plan of attack:

> We can get you in. Well, the four five of us, we can run and herd the infected
around like cattle. We've done it before, in supply runs, to buy others more time
when they need it to gather more supplies. Don't tell Nerkith we've done this though.

## Lori's Oath
Lori the servant girl twitches at the corner, as if wanting to tell
the PCs something but also doesn't want to say it.

She had seen her master Cikei's plans for the temple by accident, and she had sworn
to keep the hidden fort and the exit passage a secret.

> What would you do if you've sworn a death oath to someone whose memory you want to
honor, but for breaking it I might help save the people he surely cares about?

The entrance to the passage is west of the camp, within particular thick growth of
mushrooms. The same type of sigil used to mark the way through the tunnels would
mark the entrance and the path should lead under the river and through a network
below the city. Many people don't know it, but the network also forms the city's
sewage system.

## Merchant
Uvat, a thin, tall, and lanky ashling, is willing to part with a small cache of
alchemic and consumable items for market price.

![portrait-gydra-and-xesom.jpg](portrait-gydra-and-xesom.jpg)
## Sword Arms
Gydra and Xesom guards the way between the camp and the bridge. They lament that
the barricades on the bridge are now destroyed and there's no hope to try and
reinforce the camp without incurring great losses.

![portrait-omiros.jpg](portrait-omiros.jpg)
## The Old Druid
Omiros is accessible through the memory core. He explains the basic use of the
core: 1/day store the memory of about everything that had happened in the last
10 minutes, usually as a form of diary; recalling knowledge either from stored
memory or the collected wisdom within the core. Wisdom save DC starts at current
level difficulty +2, and adds +2 more each time it's used on the same day.

# Storming the Temple
Once the PCs make a decision, Nerkith leads the survivors up
the tunnels toward Keroc above. Before they leave, Nerkith salutes
Yitha as a prince (right hand over left shoulder, a 45 degree bow) 
and leaves her with the following words:

> Save our people, if you can. But remember, you are not beholden to
your family's legacy - your life is your own. Our god is dead and our
kingdom had disappeared, but we the people will carry on. With time,
everything can be rebuilt.

> Champions, I leave Yitha in your care. Keep her safe. She is more valuable
to us than that cursed artifact, not because she is the prince's daughter, but
because everyone here is indebted to her dedication and kindness.

## Frontal attack
Known risk, but risk level is high. Hethor's plan will work up to a point,
but Grevik would likely kill one or two of the runners beofre the PCs can
make it to the temple. If no other plans are available, it might be a suicide
run to try and make it to the front entrance alive.

## Temple Grounds
The PCs would fight Grevik the Lawbinder, 3 worm slingers, and 2 zealots,
plus an unlimited supplies of infected. Crumbling stones from the ceiling
fall on one of the 8 designated areas around the temple.

`Falling Damage = 1/2 falling distance. Stones from 30ft = 15pts of blungeoning damage`

![xyndrasis-secret-path.jpeg](xyndrasis-secret-path.jpeg)

## The Secret Way
The PCs travel through the tunnels, partially through the sewers (no longer
smelling foul since the ashlings had fled), using the amulet or the old military
sign cantrip to find the way to the secret door.

## Sickness at the Watering Hole
Two kobold friends stay near the watering hole on the way to the
secret entrance. One of them had been newly infected, and
requires an antidote. If the PCs reveal they have a dose
(or don't stop Yitha from telling) and they act harshly and
not share, the kobolds attack.

## Hallway
The Truthseeker Tighis are on Stage 3 Spider Venom at the end of
the hallway, and would die for sure
if the poison is not neutralized. A pile of Potions
of Shared Memories surround him, forming a neat row next to his body.
There are memories of:
- The council meeting and leaving the chamber
- Trying to manipulate something at the pedestal before fleeing the animated armor
- Fleeing the spiders while clutching the last of the supplies.

## The Spider Nest
Two hunting spiders and a swarm guards a Potion of Shared
Memories containing half of the solution to open the door
to the shadow labs. The food supplies here had been spoiled
or eaten by the spiders.

## Resting Quarters
Nothing of import here, just beds and well manintained but mundane equipment.

## Murder Hole
Leading to the room, two arrow slits can be seen. The mechanism to open/close
the gate between the hallway and the murder hole is broken, the door is half
stuck open. DC 15 to drop it back down permenantly, a combined strength of 25 
(roll + bonuses) is required to force it open.

Empty but trapped (10ft pit dropping 15ft for 7pts of damage + 2d8 if impaled,
only exit must be unlocked from the other side) 

## Controlling the traps
DC 20 to spot the mechanisms,
DC 25 to spot the pit trap opening, DC 22 disable device.
The mechanism is required to open the secret door to the viewing chamber.

# Viewing Chambers
Illusion of the tears in the room center floating. floor crack
leaks unholy energy from below, causing 1d4 void damage to anyone
staying near the pedestal.

Trying to come within 5 ft of the tear activates the animated armor.

The Shepard, the Truthseeker, and the Oathkeeper's chambers
are here.
