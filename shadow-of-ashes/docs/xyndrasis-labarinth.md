# The Labrinth Tunnels

```
The tunnels feels half natural with signs of deliberate manipulation, as if
the entire point of the tunnel was to mislead interlopers so they would
lose their way. The path wind back and forth, up and down, splitting in a fork
or an intersection for every few minutes of walking. As you follow the
blue glow of the signs and symbols lit by the darkstone crystals,
you make slow and steady progress downwards deeper into the labrinth.

# Encounters in the tunnels

## Off the Beaten Path
Should the party decide to not follow the signs, 1d4:

### 1. Collapsing Tunnel
Rocks collapse, splitting the party and dealing 1d6 damage to anyone
trapped between the rocks. Relevant skills (Nature, Survival) DC 12 to spot.

### 2. Glow Spores
A colony of nightbloom grows rapidly up a cliff.

### 3. Dead refugees
Long dead refugees with valuables: 1d10gp 1d10sp, Aeon Stone, Diary:
On the way down to Xyndrasis lost sight of the main group and trapped
in the tunnels, starved to death.

### 4. Ghost of the refugees
Can lead PCs to encounter #3 DC 14 Diplomacy. Leaves when threatened.

## Rescuing Hethor
The familiar clicking sound of Carrion Beetles are mixed with the battle grunts of
another humanoid. The PCs can follow the sound down a path where they'd encounter
Hethor battling two infected Carrion Beetles. Hethor is scouting and attempting
to map out the tunnels (poorly). He is injured. He does not know the exact way
back, but can fumble back to Xyndrasis at half the rate that the PCs can travel
following the signs.

## Grand Overlook

The canonical tunnel path eventually leads to an overlook at the north side of the
cavern system that leads to a grand view of the subterranean city, Xyndrasis. Hethor
can point out the major landmarks (survivor's camp, Temple of the Frozen Shadow). The
city is covered in fluorescent spores known to the outsiders as blight (but the
proper name for the mushroom and spores is Nightbloom).
