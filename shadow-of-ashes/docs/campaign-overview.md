Dargon must be dead
Therefore escape tunnels must be sealed
Can this lead PCs to the keep?

- Yes he has a diary

Auric went to Verzog Keep for a reason

- He went to retrieve the shard of eternity
- Zara told him about it

Why was Auric lured to the keep, what does OPFOR want ?
- Consume Auric to rebirth Mak Gorim

Who is OPFOR?
- OPFOR is still Mak Gorim

Why must Stormhaven be destroyed?
