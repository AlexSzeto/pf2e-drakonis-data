# The Labrinth Tunnels

```
The tunnels feels half natural with signs of deliberate manipulation, as if
the entire point of the tunnel was to mislead interlopers so they would
lose their way. The path wind back and forth, up and down, splitting in a fork
or an intersection for every few minutes of walking. As you follow the
blue glow of the signs and symbols lit by the darkstone crystals,
you make slow and steady progress downwards deeper into the labrinth.

# Encounters in the tunnels

## Rescuing Mezer
The familiar clicking sound of Carrion Beetles are mixed with the battle grunts of
another humanoid. The PCs can follow the sound down a path where they'd encounter
Mezer battling two infected Carrion Beetles. Mezer is scouting and attempting
to map out the tunnels (poorly). He is injured. He does not know the exact way
back, but can fumble back to Xyndrasis at half the rate that the PCs can travel
following the signs.
