# The Mad Prince's Invasion

The survivors of Xyndrasis continues to pack. Yitha leaves the
PCs to formulate a plan of attack with the PCs while she bids
her friends and loved ones goodbye.

Once the PCs make a decision, Nerkith leads the survivors up
the tunnels toward Keroc above. Before they leave, Nerkith salutes
Yitha as a prince and leaves her with the following words:

> Remember that you are not beholden to your family's legacy - your
life is your own. Our god is dead and our kingdom had fallen. With time
everything can be rebuilt, but when people are gone they are gone forever.
You are more valuable to us than this city and its gods forsaken artifact
combined. Save our people, if you can - but at some point, you'll have
to learn how to let go.

## Temple layout knowledge
Everyone should know the layout of the top floor. Loribel the architect
is willing to share the meditation chambers layout. She had sworn
an oath punishable by death to keep the alternate passage a secret. She would
not know about the secret labs.

## Frontal attack
Known risk, but risk level is high. If no other plans are
available, Yitha or the PCs can try to convince 1d4 able fighters
to help escort the PCs to the temple (some will likely die).
It is a suicide run (DC 23 diplomacy)

The PCs would fight the Hounds (female)
and her hunting squad on the temple ground level. Crumbling
stones and pillars are hazards. Dozen zombies,
3 worm slingers, 1 zealot

## The Secret Way
The entrance that goes under the river and into the lower floor
of the temple. If Yitha is present diplomacy must be used (DC 23),
Nerkith would suggest intimidation (DC 20).

## Sickness at the Watering Hole
Two kobold friends stay near the watering hole on the way to the
secret entrance. One of them had been newly infected, and
requires an antidote. If the PCs reveal they have a dose
(or don't stop Yitha from telling) and they act harshly and
not share, the kobolds attack.

## The Spider Nest
Two hunting spiders and a swarm guards a Potion of Shared
Memories containing half of the solution to open the door
to the shadow labs. The food supplies here had been spoiled
or eaten by the spiders.

## Sleeping Quarters
The Truthseeker Tighis had died from poison. A pile of Potions
of Shared Memories surround him, seemingly scounged from the
clutches of the spiders. There are memories of:
- The initial attack
- Walking back into the labs, then fleeing again
- Investigating the pedestal with suspicion, clues to discover
the secret door
- Fleeing the spiders while clutching the last of the supplies.

## Murder Hole
empty but trapped (10ft pit dropping 15ft, only exit must be
unlocked from the other side) DC 18 to spot the mechanisms
controlling the traps

## Meditation Chambers
Illusion of the tears in the room center floating. floor crack
leaks unholy energy from below, causing 1d4 void damage to anyone
staying near the pedestal.

```
 A staff lies on a pedestal with a thin layer of sand on top. Both the staff and the pedestal radiates with magic. A heavy door ahead, sealed by impenetrable magic, has this riddle written in elven:

"My staff is my scale, the sand my canvas. To follow my path, draw the note that makes me whole"
```
The Shepard, the Truthseeker, and the Oathkeeper's chambers
are here.
