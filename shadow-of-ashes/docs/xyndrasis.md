# The Labrinth Tunnels

```
The tunnels feels half natural with signs of deliberate manipulation, as if
the entire point of the tunnel was to mislead interlopers so they would
lose their way. The path wind back and forth, up and down, splitting in a fork
or an intersection for every few minutes of walking. As you follow the
blue glow of the signs and symbols lit by the darkstone crystals,
you make slow and steady progress downwards deeper into the labrinth.

# Encounters in the tunnels

## Off the Beaten Path
Should the party decide to not follow the signs, 1d4:

### 1. Collapsing Tunnel
Rocks collapse, splitting the party and dealing 1d6 damage to anyone
trapped between the rocks. Relevant skills (Nature, Survival) DC 12 to spot.

### 2. Glow Spores
A colony of nightbloom grows rapidly up a cliff.

### 3. Dead refugees
Long dead refugees with valuables: 1d10gp 1d10sp, Aeon Stone, Diary:
On the way down to Xyndrasis lost sight of the main group and trapped
in the tunnels, starved to death.

### 4. Ghost of the refugees
Can lead PCs to encounter #3 DC 14 Diplomacy. Leaves when threatened.

## Rescuing Hethor
The familiar clicking sound of Carrion Beetles are mixed with the battle grunts of
another humanoid. The PCs can follow the sound down a path where they'd encounter
Hethor battling two infected Carrion Beetles. Hethor is scouting and attempting
to map out the tunnels (poorly). He is injured. He does not know the exact way
back, but can fumble back to Xyndrasis at half the rate that the PCs can travel
following the signs.

## Grand Overlook

The canonical tunnel path eventually leads to an overlook at the north side of the
cavern system that leads to a grand view of the subterranean city, Xyndrasis. Hethor
can point out the major landmarks (survivor's camp, Temple of the Frozen Shadow). The
city is covered in fluorescent spores known to the outsiders as blight (but the
proper name for the mushroom and spores is Nightbloom).

# Survivor's Camp

The PCs meet two groups of survivors, those who want to leave and those who wish
to investigate/retrieve the artifact/save the prince. None who ventured into the
temple returned. The camp currently has 32 survivors (including Hethor), divided
into two groups:

## Rescuers

Led by Zara's younger sister Yi'sha, the group consists of 12 people total including
Yi'sha and Hethor. They lean younger, and still maintains hope that the city can
be saved.

## Exiles

Led by Nerkith, a grizzled and hardy farmer who is calm but firm, insists that his
group of 20 and everyone else leave through the tunnels.

# What the ashlings know about the situation:
> During the invasion some 65 years ago, Zara led a group of refugees out of
Xyndrasis to seek aid from the fae elves. The two did not part on good terms.
Prince Renu felt justifiably angry and
betrayed, and activated all the security measures and limited access to darkstone
amulets, effectively sealing the city off from outside influences. The prince
becomes increasingly reclusive and eccentric.

> 3 months ago, the city was shocked by a wave of arcane energy, then waves of
void worms flood the city, killing most of the inhabitants. Four of the strongest
fighters (Ducir, Nokac, Vuka, Rucar) ventured into the temple months ago but did not return. 
An elder priest, Loris, is able to keep the survivors alive by creating water and purifying food, but the
remaining supplies are dwindling. Without a darkstone amulet, the survivors are
trapped.
