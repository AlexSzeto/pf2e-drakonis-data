### Wedding night
Tavern uneventful. 

### Celebration day
Morning - message from Lumi:
```
1 hour past Starrise at the Gaping Maw, don't be late
P*S* Father knew where I'll be and we're bringing protection. I'm not that dumb.
```
Two guards stands outside, hidden.

Food is delicious. seafood everywhere.

Salvia shows up to play
Auric visibly moved
People argue, bar fight erupts

### The Hangover
Summoned by Edwin this time

> Dagon had escaped. He wasn't telling us anything before he disappeared. There's always a guard on watch and the lock is not tempered. Can you look into it, for free?

### Secret Tunnels

PCs find Dagon diary.
- Info about the Burning Hand cult (easy)
- Fact that the cult dwelling requires a password to open that rotates (medium)
- Most recent entry about the tunnel collapse, signs of the cave worm
 
### Morning after
Lumi and Auric departs, Auric leaves notes for PCs

```
The location of Mak Gorim had been revealed.
I would feel a lot safer if the secret hidden is in your hands.
Take this amulet to light the way when you're lost.
```
