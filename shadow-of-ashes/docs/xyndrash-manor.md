## Balcony

```
The balcony overlooks the city. The damp and stale air is
occasionally broken up by a breeze, stirring the spores that illuminates the air.
```

## Ortho's room (closer to the balcony)
```
A male butler's simple room. Spartan, but neat and tidy.
```
Cabinet contains about 1g7s (after searching, including a silver cuff link and a set fine formal clothing)

## Sidie's room
```
A personal attendant's simple room. A thinning hint of perfume remains.
```
Personal effects amount to 1g3s (after searching, including inexpensive jewelry and a few bottles of perfumes)

## Storeroom

Piled with junk. Nothing of value here.

## Master Bedroom

Prince Renu's early notes (DC 20 Arcana)

> Although the priests in the temple had been using the artifact as a fountain of divine energy,
the magic that emanates from the Tears of Xovina are in fact, draconic. It is pure magic, superseding
channeling from specific magical traditions. Renu excitedly makes the next step in the plan - harness
 arcane energy to mass produce permenant enchanted objects.

There are also 60gp worth of goods here: Jewels (from Renu's former mate, Vyssa, who passed away from surface disease when Yitha was too young to remember) 34gp, rare books 10gp, art items 16gp.
Yitha is extremely uncomfortable about the PCs trying to loot these items.

## Winery

4 bottles of priceless prewar aged white wine
6 bottles of fine wine (1sp ea)
endless supplies of cheaper booze

## Kitchen

> A foul odor can be sensed from far outside the door. Inside, the stench of rotten food is nearly unbearable.

Zombified Ortho (Zealot) and 4x crawler swarm infests this room. The door can be barricated to prevent Orthos from attacking.

## Dining Room

> A once elegant banquet room had been reduced to a simple, functional dining room, now ruined by infestation.

2x zombies wander here.

## Foyer

> A grand foyer featuring a statue of Nerxalis.

4x zombies wander here.

## Zara's room

> Neatly maintained despite its owner being long gone.

## Yitha's room

> Yitha requests to pack up some items (clothing, socks, journal)

Door to the lab is protected by the same musical arcane lock as the Xyndrasis tunnels entrance.

Surprisingly few notes remain.

Reinforcing Rune, Wand of Charm, 2 Runestones. Rest of the items are defective or ruined.

Door to Zero's chamber is protected by an Electric Latch Rune (Stealth DC 20, Disable DC 20 or counterspell DC 18. Damage 3d12 DC22 Reflex Save)

> Zero is defective. Moves too slowly. Lost an arm when Renu took it out in frustration after realizing it cannot be improved.
The heart crystal is made from the same material as the darkstone amulet (a more advanced form)
Zero can give up his heart to turn a Darkstone Amulet into a Shining Symbol.
