# Clue gathering
- The Guards do not help with the fire.
- Broken vials of lesser alchemist's fire and accelerants can be found at fire scene.
- The fire burns from the bottom up.
- At night, the wind blows from land to sea, dismissing the theory that the fire is caused by fireworks.

## What Edwin knows:
- Absolutely nothing!
- He would suggest that the PCs ask Reginald for help.
- If pressed for payment, he reluctantly coughs up a cold iron token for Borja

## What Zekie knows:
- Carved in fine print on the handle of the battle axe: Rydia of the Preservers, Honored Guardian of Tharudain
- Aggressively geometric patterns carved into the face of the axe.
- Rydia left Highmountain in 84 ES, 3 years after war broke out. She left Highmountain the day after she became a Preserver Guardian.
- Zekie followd in 101 ES, 17 years later, and did not find her sister, and immediately put to work.

## What Zara knows:
- (might be able to meet PCs before the fire, if they decide to retire before nightfall)
- She left Xyndrasis (now the Ruins of Karoc) at 39 ES
- Sheltered by the Court of the Stars, but the elves are generally unhappy about her stay.
- She opend up about her father and the lost city to Auric, who convinced her to give him a chance to see what had happened.
- She immediately regrets it and lied to Auric about the location of Xyndrasis
- Finally decides to leave Faewind to ensure Auric's safety

## What Reginald knows:
- He is aware of the Burning Hands but writes them off as peasant rabbles.
- If forced to investigate the Night of Flames, he'd promise to send guards to investigate (then doesn't)

## What Burt knows:
- He's been hit by the Fire.
- Roughly follows the history of the Burning Hands, including recent development that people had gone off city grounds without coming back.
- If the PCs can prove that they serve the good of the people, he will personally task the PCs to investigate.
