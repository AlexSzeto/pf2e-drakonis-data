# Into the Ruins

## Outside
(TODO: Insert illustration here)
```
Outside the ruins of the city of Karoc,
There are indications of dig sites everywhere. While no more men works on the surface,
Dozens of skeletons in ones and twos mindlessly patrol the eerily dead city.
```

Mindless skeletons roam the perimeter, keeping away unarmed travellers
An alarm alerts Houndmaster + 4 hyenas to the investigate.

Every few hours, cultists in red robes appear above the ruins.

# The Arsonists Fireworks Finale

- Happens after PCs leave Haycrest Manor
- At the same time as the fireworks (3 hours past Starrise, or 9pm)
- 6 targets:
    1. The Gutting Hole
    2. Lucita (outspoken commoner leader)'s Home
    3. The Den
    4. Gaping Maw
    5. and 6. Random targets

### Clue gathering
- The Guards do not help with the fire.
- Broken vials of lesser alchemist's fire and accelerants can be found at fire scene.
- The fire burns from the bottom up.
- At night, the wind blows from land to sea, dismissing the theory that the fire is caused by fireworks.
