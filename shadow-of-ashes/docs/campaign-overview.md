## The Great War
Lasts roughly 1000 years

Avian race - skirmishers
Ashlings - archers 
Sporeling Forests - thick spore fog, think Zangamarsh
Fungal Giants - mounts for calvary, grows fast
The biggest ones become siege breakers - opening up paths for warriors to go up battlements

Ashling war tactics - bring in siege breaking spore giants,
soften breachhead with concentrated nightbloom clouds, 
breach and hold with melee fighters, regular army can come in through the opening

Moondusting is the tactic of covering an area with spores.
The armies of light call it blight bombing - hence the name.


Eidran core - is somewhere in the body, can travel back home.

Verzog Keep
- Instructions from Dargon leads to Ashling prince living area
- Cultists, orc recruits, undead, The Herald
- Mak Gorim holds a shard

Who is The Herald?
- Agent of prince Mordok


# Solving Constants:

Dargon must be dead
Therefore escape tunnels must be sealed
Can this lead PCs to the keep?

- Yes he has a diary

Auric went to Verzog Keep for a reason

- He went to retrieve the shard of eternity
- Zara told him about it

Why was Auric lured to the keep, what does OPFOR want ?
- Consume Auric to rebirth Mak Gorim

Who is OPFOR?
- OPFOR is still Mak Gorim

Why must Stormhaven be destroyed?

# Aelindra, The Dragon Goddess of Wind
Category	Factoid
Domain	Wind/Air, Creativity, Freedom.
Allegiance	The Chaos/Darkness Faction (patron of the slain Dragon God Nerxalis).
Status	Fled to the outskirts of the Empire to organize resistance alongside Pyra.
Form of Resistance	Secretly operates as a traveling bard (in disguise). Her purpose is to inspire hope, free thought, and the practice of wild magic in the populace.
Relationship to Pyra	Pyra (Goddess of Fire/Impulsive Desires) does not get along with Aelindra, finding her methods too weak. Pyra's resistance through terror and eldritch abominations complicates Aelindra's efforts.
Immortal Status	Like all Dragon Gods, Aelindra is unknowingly immortal and will resurrect if slain, a fact currently unknown even to the gods.

# The Order of the Silver Feather
Category	Factoid
Creator	Aelindra, formed as her most profound act of creation since the rise of the Empire.
Membership	Individuals personally recruited by Aelindra for their strong moral character, free thought, creativity, and will to save the innocent. Members include adventurers, artists, and spies.
Purpose	To act as the benevolent hands of the resistance, serving the greater good by protecting the enslaved and oppressed, and fighting the rigid, fact-driven dogma of the Empire.
Symbol	A Silver Feather Pin, worn by all members.
Powers of the Pin	Imbued with Aelindra's wind and chaos magic, the pin grants three main abilities: 1. Telepathic Whispers (instant, untraceable long-distance communication); 2. Momentary Inspiration (a flash of creative insight or language understanding in crisis); and 3. Untraceable Passage (momentarily makes the wearer undetectable by physical surveillance).
