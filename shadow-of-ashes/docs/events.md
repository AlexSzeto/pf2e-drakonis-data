# Into the Ruins

## Outside
(TODO: Insert illustration here)
```
Outside the ruins of the city of Karoc,
There are indications of dig sites everywhere. While no more men works on the surface,
Dozens of skeletons in ones and twos mindlessly patrol the eerily dead city.

At the center of the town, a hole in the middle of a clearing, leading into parts unknown.
One of the half ruined buildings with a barely intact ceiling hosts a camp of cultists.
```

Mindless skeletons roam the perimeter, keeping away unarmed travellers
An alarm alerts Houndmaster + 4 hyenas to the investigate.

Every few hours, cultists in red robes appear above the ruins.
