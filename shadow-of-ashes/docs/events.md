other members attending the council meeting?

# The Mad Prince's Invasion

- The survivors of Xyndrasis continues to pack. Yitha begins 
to formulate a plan of attack with the PCs. Nerkith pulls the
ashling aside to try to instill the idea that if in doubt,
abandon plan.

## Temple layout knowledge
Everyone should know the layout of the top floor. The architect
is willing to share the meditation chambers layout. She would
not know about the secret labs.

## Frontal attack
Known risk, but risk level is high. If no other plans are
available, Yitha or the PCs can try to convince 1d4 able fighters
to help escort the PCs to the temple (some will likely die).
It is a suicide run (DC 23 diplomacy)

The PCs would fight the Hounds (female)
and her hunting squad on the temple ground level. Crumbling
stones and pillars are hazards. Dozen zombies,
3 worm slingers, 1 zealot

## The Secret Way
Convince the architect (female) to break her oath and reveal
the entrance that goes under the river and into the lower floor
of the temple. If Yitha is present diplomacy must be used (DC 23),
Nerkith would suggest intimidation (DC 20).

## Sickness at the Watering Hole
Two kobold friends stay near the watering hole on the way to the
secret entrance. One of them had been newly infected, and
requires an antidote. If the PCs reveal they have a dose
(or don't stop Yitha from telling) and they act harshly and
not share, the kobolds attack.

## The Spider Nest
Two hunting spiders and a swarm guards a Potion of Shared
Memories containing half of the solution to open the door
to the shadow labs. The food supplies here had been spoiled
or eaten by the spiders.

## Sleeping Quarters
The Truthseeker (male) had died from poison. A pile of Potions
of Shared Memories surround him, seemingly scounged from the
clutches of the spiders. There are memories of:
- The initial attack
- Walking back into the labs, then fleeing again
- Investigating the pedestal with suspicion, clues to discover
the secret door
- Fleeing the spiders while clutching the last of the supplies.

## Murder Hole
empty but trapped (10ft pit dropping 15ft, only exit must be
unlocked from the other side) DC 18 to spot the mechanisms
controlling the traps

## Meditation Chambers
Illusion of the tears in the room center floating. floor crack
leaks unholy energy from below, causing 1d4 void damage to anyone
staying near the pedestal.

The Shepard, the Truthseeker, and the Oathkeeper's chambers
are here.
