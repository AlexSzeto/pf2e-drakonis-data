It's a storeroom converted into a prison with a padlock added to the outside.

### Makeshift Prison
The padlock was not tempered.
Temporary straw bed in one corner
Bucket for waste. Used and not cleaned. (Guard can take it out)
Empty crates and barrels on the side. They don't seem used. Unlikely used for escape.
Secret door  (40xp) pushes inwards. A metal latch behind a stone brick to the right of the door DC18 unlocks the door DC24. Door is one way but can be easily propped open.

### Damp Corridor
Wet, recent and makeshift construction, poorly maintained.
Moldy. Exposed and sections looks poorly reinforced. Roof supports are buckling inwards

Northen passage collapsed. Exposed sections of the wall can be examined (Geology/Nature 15) to determine that the collapse is unnatural, DC18 to determine it is caused by a cave crawler

Level 3 Cave Crawler
enters the area from an exposed wall but does not chase the player into other areas.
Roll d4 to determine spawn point, or block player directly trying to enter next area.

(60xp)
