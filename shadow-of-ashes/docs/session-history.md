# Wedding Night
Nothing important happened.

# Celebration Day

## First Light
PCs picked up message from Lumi:

> 1 hour past Starrise at the Gaping Maw, don't be late\
> P\*S\* Father knew where I'll be and we're bringing protection. I'm not that dumb.

PCs wandered around the Great Bazaar
1. unsuccessfully purchased a healing potion
2. stole a bracelet from a noble in the crowd that's watching the wedding festivities
3. played carnival games that impressed the locals

## Midsun

1. visited the Fragrant Teahouse, and handed over the sigil ring at the front door to Kerissa
2. visited the archives to learn about the Scarred Man asking about the ruins
3. unsuccessfully found new work

## Starrise

At the Gaping Maw, elven elite guards (farstriders) stand outside, awkwardly half hidden. Lumi and Auric wave the PCs in and have a meal together.

1. Brisa performed, and Auric was moved. Bar fights erupt
2. Auric was convinced to tell the PCs about his ashling friend at home, and agree to part with his darkstone amulet
3. The guards break up the fight, and Brisa convinces the PCs that she would be fine.

The PCs escorted Auric and Lumi home. 

1. Auric gives Typha the darkstone amulet
 
> Take this, so that you may find the light in the dark.

2. In front of Lumi, Edwin promises room and board for another week and (cheaper) horses for exploration.
3. Edwin tells the PC that Dagon had escaped
 
> Dagon had escaped. He wasn't telling us anything before he disappeared. There's always a guard on watch and the lock is not tempered. Can you look into it, as a favor for what I'm giving you?

## Makeshift Prison

1. The guard on watch did occasionally doze off but is convinced the lock was not tempered.
2. PCs discovered the secret door. Edwin was called and everyone was baffled.
3. The locked door opens inward, and has a handle to operate on both sides of the door.
