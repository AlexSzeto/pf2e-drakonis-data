# Into the Ruins

## Outside
(TODO: Insert illustration here)
```
Outside the ruins of the city of Karoc,
There are indications of dig sites everywhere. While no more men works on the surface,
Dozens of skeletons in ones and twos mindlessly patrol the eerily dead city.

At the center of the town, a hole in the middle of a clearing, leading into parts unknown.
One of the half ruined buildings with a barely intact ceiling hosts a camp of cultists.
```

Mindless skeletons roam the perimeter, keeping away unarmed travellers. They are commanded to attack anyone not wearing red, or flee and alert when they observe anyone not wearing red.
An alarm alerts a hunting party of 2 Spearmen and 2 Hyenas.

Every 8 hours, cultists in red robes appear above the ruins and change shift with the next group.

## Temple Floor

### Entrance
1 Spearmen 1 Guardian guard this area. They attack intruder, or call for Junka if the PCs are in disguise.

> You maggots are standing around as if you're here to sightsee. Get your arses off to work!

If he sees any weapons:

> Why are you carrying weapons around like they belong to you? Hand those off to the Quartermaster now, then head off to work!

### Armory

```
A grizzled old veteran Orc oversees an arsenal of weapons, crude but neatly maintained and in tip top shape. He is working on the grindstone.
```

> My name is Xugan, your quartermaster. Hand over your weapons, and maybe you'll have them back when the Brotherhood needs you to fight.

Xugan inspects the weapons and notices that they are already well maintained

> I see that you are no ordinary farmers or workers. So, what are you really here for. Grave robbing? Spies for the Rats? Please don't tell me that baffoon Edwin or that slob Reginald sent you. For what they're paying you you might as well work at the docks hauling crates.

If the PCs are honest Xugan is willing to sell information and trade.

Armory content: TBD

### Central Courtyard

Jugka is almost always here with his two escorts (1 Guardian, 1 Spearman) ordering people around. The divine presense of Xovina can be felt here (anyone with Religion). A pack of 4 Hyenas rest here if they're not out hunting.  
1 full set of guards (2 Spearmen, 2 Guardians) patrol the halls.

### Dig Site

```
The sound of iron striking rock and dirt is constant here. Stuffy and smelling off sweat and rotting food, an ogre constantly commands the other cultists to dig, shovel, and move dirt.
```

Digrot commands all the cultists here to continue digging with much cruelty. The cultists can be convinced to rebel against their master, and cause a distraction escaping through the entrance.

### Bone Sorting

Two cultists are stationed here sorting bones into a complete skeleton, pocketing treasures buried in the bones. Occasionally one hauls a load into the Summoning Chamber.

### Inner Chamer Passage

1 Spearman 1 Guardian patrol this area.

### Potion Brewing Room

All potions here expire in 10 days. Crates of almost limitless Minor Alchemist's Fire is available here.
