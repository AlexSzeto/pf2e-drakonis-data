# Xyndrasis overview
Pre-infection, the city has about 1000 citizens.
Surrounded by nightbloom (blight), the bioluminescent fungi grows freely outside of buildings.
Flesh is made into flour. Spore is mildly toxic to non ashlings (Dreamweave poison). Can be refined into various medication including purging tonic.

## Zombies as environment hazard
Each PC roll base DC 20 (Athletics outer edges, Survival/Stealth on the streets). on failed check roll 1D6 on damage table:
- 1. crawler bite (1d4 piercing)
- 2. crawler bite (1d4 piercing)
- 3. zombie bite (1d8+4 blunt)
- 4. crawler bite + inject 
- 5. zombie bite + inject
- 6. trip/grab + bite (roll initiative)
crit fails roll twice, crit success saves 1 PC from next roll check.

## Random Location Descriptions

# Buildings in the city
![map-xyndrasis.jpg](map-xyndrasis.jpg)

## A - Survivor's Camp

The bridge and river makes the buildings defensible. These were poor houses and
outposts and now they are crammed to the brim with survivors.

The PCs meet two groups of survivors, those who want to leave and those who wish
to investigate/retrieve the artifact/save the prince. None dare venturing far
enough to the temple. The camp currently has 62 survivors (including Hethor), divided
into two groups:

## Rescuers

Led by Zara's younger sister Yi'sha, the group consists of 14 people total including
Yi'sha and Hethor. They lean younger, and still maintains hope that the city can
be saved.

## Exiles

Led by Nerkith, a grizzled and hardy cleric of Nerxalis who is calm but firm, insists that his
group of 48 and everyone else leave through the tunnels.

### What the ashlings know about the situation:
> During the invasion some 65 years ago, Zara led a group of refugees out of
Xyndrasis to seek aid from the fae elves. The two did not part on good terms.
Prince Renu felt justifiably angry and
betrayed, and activated all the security measures and limited access to darkstone
amulets, effectively sealing the city off from outside influences. The prince
becomes increasingly reclusive and eccentric.

> 3 months ago, the city was shocked by a wave of divine energy, then waves of
void crawlers flood the city, infecting most of the inhabitants. Four of the strongest
fighters (Ducir, Nokac, Vuka, Rucar) ventured into the temple months ago but did not return. 
An elder priest, Nerkith, is able to keep the survivors alive by creating water and purifying food, but the
remaining supplies are dwindling. Without a darkstone amulet, the survivors are
trapped.

## B - Armory  

**Infection Level**: Medium (+0 DC).
The outer room is being defended by an activated Arcane Golem, defending against all invaders. Activation Code can be obtained from notes in Renu's home room or from Zero.

While the breached outer room consists of common weapons (buckler, clubs, morning stars, flails, rapiers, bows, arrows), armor (leather, chainmail, half plates), and equipment (torches, belts),
the locked treasury room contains 
- **spiked gauntlet +1,**  
- **+1 striking rapier,**  
- **onyx panther (Nerxalis aligned),**  
- **crying angel pendant (Xovina aligned)**  
- **32 gold,**  

## D - Obsidian Trade House (General Store)

Has a back entrance on the far side of the entrance (Locked, disable device 18 or strength check 18).
Supplies for the survivors.

## E - Food Store (Mostly Depleted)

**Infection Level**: Low (-2 DC)

## F - Xyndrash Manor  

**Infection Level**: High (+2 DC)

The early notes about Renu's research can be found here. He was able to convert Properties of the Tear
as an arcane/divine object, attunement process, and its innate ability to
boost divine magic and promote growth.

Experiment Log: Project Golemheart - Initial Failures  
Subject: Conversion of Divine Aether from 'The Tears of Xovina' for Arcane Golem Animata.  
Date of Entry: 3 years ago

Entry #17-B.IV  
 
The latest iteration of the Heartstone fabrication process remains agonizingly slow. While the captured divine aether from the Tears of Xovina proves potent, its extraction and conversion into a stable, arcana-compliant form for the Heartstone matrix is proving a significant bottleneck.  
 
My initial hypothesis, that the sheer influx of divine energy would accelerate the geode's arcane assimilation, was flawed. Instead, the Tear's essence resists immediate transmutation, demanding a delicate, protracted siphoning and a precise, multi-stage alchemical bath for each individual Heartstone. This is not a process to be rushed. Each Heartstone, intended as a rudimentary proxy for the Tears, takes a full cycle of 13 sunrises to properly imbue. Unacceptable.  
 
Furthermore, the integration of these nascent Heartstones into the golem shells presents its own set of inefficiencies. The arcane sigils required to properly bind the converted energy to the construct's stone form are intricate, demanding weeks of precise carving and enchantment per unit. Even a single 'standard' stone golem requires a full month of dedicated labor, assuming optimal conditions and no interference from the inherent stability issues of the nascent Heartstone.  
 
The envisioned scale of Project Golemheart demands an output far beyond these current parameters. An army built at this pace would be obsolete before it saw the light of a battlefield. The enemy would overrun us a thousand times over.  
 
This method, while conceptually sound in its energy conversion, is an unmitigated failure for mass production. Its lack of speed and efficiency renders it strategically unviable. I must seek an alternative method for animata creation, one that bypasses these temporal restraints and truly embodies the swift, overwhelming force I require. The Tears hold more secrets; I must simply find the correct key to unlock their boundless potential, and a more pliable medium for its expression.  

Status: Method Abandoned. Focusing research on a more direct, less material-dependent conduit for animating force.
